<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Payroll Demo

![Project Payroll Demo](/Assets/03-javascript-homework-demo.gif)


This project was designed to teach us about creating and calling functions. This simple payroll app has great example use cases for how we can utilize an existing array of objects and pass that data around to display it neatly in a table. 

Here's why we're doing this:
* Putting to use our basic understanding of JavaScript
* Once again, great refresher on version control, Git, and GitHub
* Showcase the importance of Math.random()
